# Project to try GraphQL and PrismaORM
## Technology stack:
NestJS - the main backend framework
GraphQL (@nestjs/graphql) - API for working with books and comments
Prisma ORM - for working with PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL - database
Docker - for deploying PostgreSQL
Apollo Client 
Jest + Supertest - for testing

## Goal: 
Develop a backend(build api) for a platform that allows users to add books(stories), view details, and leave comments, raiting.
Provide hands-on experience with GraphQL API, Prisma ORM and NestJS. 
Optionally, refresh the practical skills of transaction isolation levels.
